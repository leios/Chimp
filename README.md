Charles, the Infinite Monkey Poet

====

So. You are sitting at home, listening to music, watching television, or 
whatever it is that people like you do. You then think to yourself, "Man, I
Wish I had this little monkey that generated random letters and from these
random letters could generate lyrics for a song or something." Well, that's 
what this code is for! Sure, it's still a work in progress, but you know what?
So is everything else! It'll take a few months before I have anything worth
mentioning, though... so feel free to pop in and out at your leisure.

Toodles!

Oh, also... I run a youtube channel that will probably feature this when it is
done. Be sure to check it out!

Also: This code's a little rough. Sorry.
