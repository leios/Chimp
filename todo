-I need to finish the impwrite / impremove command

-I need to create the pentameter / rhyming scheme
--Remember that this scheme should be able to take in "ababc" and rhyme it 
  appropriately. This means that I need to be READING IN the scheme!

-I need to start working on punctuation

-Also: I have not decided whether I want some people who may or may not be 
 coming in from youtube to work on this or not.

-Note: I need to get better at writing these todo lists. If anyone is reading this or has cloned the repo, talk to me! I wanna know what you want to do!
