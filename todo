-I need to finish the impwrite / impremove command
--impwrite is almost done, I just need to add in something to write the changes to the dictionary and I should be done. 
--impremove will be necessary, but I haven't decided whether it will be necessary for this iteration of the code
--impread will be necessary, but shouldn't be too bad. We just need to output a vector of all possible words for Chimp to sift through while infinite monkey-ing (not a real phrase, but you guys can deal with it!).

-I need to look into binary file formats. I think those will make Chimp much more efficient.

-I need to create the pentameter / rhyming scheme
--Remember that this scheme should be able to take in "ababc" and rhyme it 
  appropriately. This means that I need to be READING IN the scheme!

-I need to start working on punctuation
--This should be done outside of the impff, in case someone wants to use impff for something else later on. I don't know what.

-Also: I have not decided whether I want some people who may or may not be 
 coming in from youtube to work on this or not.

-Note: I need to get better at writing these todo lists. If anyone is reading this or has cloned the repo, talk to me! I wanna know what you want to do!
