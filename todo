Note: I can use this file format for easy serching in the future if I allow for
      more than one "type" to be given to each word. I am not qute sure how to
      do this. That said, I did upload a potential possibility in testdict.imp

-I need to finish the impwrite / impremove command
--impwrite is almost done, I just need to add in something to write the changes
  to the dictionary and I should be done. 
--impremove will be necessary, but I haven't decided whether it will be 
  necessary for this iteration of the code
--impread will be necessary, but shouldn't be too bad. We just need to output a   vector of all possible words for Chimp to sift through while infinite 
  monkey-ing (not a real phrase, but you guys can deal with it!).

-I need to add in a few more functions:
--impremove_header (removes entire header)
--imptransfer (transfers rhymes from one header to another)

-I need to look into binary file formats. I think those will make Chimp much 
 more efficient.

-I need to create the pentameter / rhyming scheme
--Remember that this scheme should be able to take in "ababc" and rhyme it 
  appropriately. This means that I need to be READING IN the scheme!

-I need to start working on punctuation
--This should be done outside of the impff, in case someone wants to use impff 
  for something else later on. I don't know what they'd use it for, though...

-Also: I have not decided whether I want some people who may or may not be 
 coming in from youtube to work on this or not.

-Note: I need to get better at writing these todo lists. If anyone is reading 
 this or has cloned the repo, talk to me! I wanna know what you want to do!

-maybe make a dynamic prompt that allows manipulation of these files with just 
 an "imp" or "impff" command. I dunno. Working on it!

-Note: Potentially use this as your final project in Adaptive systems. Teach a 
 chimp to rhyme. I don't know. Maybe there is some way to incorporate it.
