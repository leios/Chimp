-I just generated a set of files that creates what seems to be random-ish 
characters. This is fine. I have yet decided whether I like the capitals in
there or not. The end-goal is to have chimp sift through the letters and spit
out any words that seem to match.

-I need to figure out a way to have the window move with the characters 
generated. We will set a max length and a time that we want the simulation to 
run, and the chimp will continually produce new letters within that window size.

-In the future, the window size will be determined by the dictionary

-Speaking of dictionaries, I've also gotta add in a mode that reads only words,
not letters at all.

-I also have to add in punctuation eventually.

-I have yet to determine the best way to store the words. They have to be 
easily accesible by both syllable and rhyme. I think I might create a bunch of
classes, or else use a multidimensional file format... I don't know.

-I need to add in a function that identifies the words once they are written
by chimp. This will be the primary purpose of the dictionary file.

-files to add: dictionary.cpp, dictionary.dat

-That's all for now, I think. Toodles!

-I think I will look into multidimensional file formats like H5 or FITS.
